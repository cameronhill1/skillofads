# The Skill of Ads
### How to get the business you deserve


## The offer

Become one of our three clients / partners...

- Performance-based relationship - we produce directly trackable results; pay nothing if we don't.
- No contracts - beyond the mandatory initial 3-month testing period, there are no commitments, for either party. We stay if it's a win-win.
- Proven, current track record - Eg. For one partner in December 2020, we collected $2.2m across Google and Facebook at an average ROI of 12.3 (results not typical).


## About you

The offer is open to you if:

- You run a relatively simple, profitable, and ethical business
- You're willing and able to quickly and easily scale once ads are profitable (no major operational ceilings, budget constraints, or red tape) - so we both stand to make good money from our work together
- You're happy to leave us to do the work and produce results - you're not going to feel uncomfortable with a lack of pretty reports and diagrams, and you certainly don't want 3 calls a week discussing the "benefits" of more likes on your Facebook page.


## About us

- We're a small... quality over quantity... We value simplicity in all things, so we can focus on can grappling with the complexities of our partners' ads and making them profitable.
- "T-stacked" abilities - Our founder/principal, Cameron, has worked in most all domains of the customer experience - from grassroots events and awareness-based promotions for major brands like Å koda and VW, to cutting his teeth in cold-calling and door-to-door sales (both for the business and the consumer), and even developing high-end websites and sophisticated marketing funnels (from high-level strategy down to button-clicking and coding), before specializing in digital advertising.
- Cameron is currently 23. If you're looking for "experience", we're not the agency for you. If you want results, we might be able to help.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
