# The Skill of Ads
### How to get the business you deserve


## The offer

Become one of our three clients / partners...

- Performance-based relationship - we produce directly trackable results; pay nothing if we don't.
- No contracts - beyond the mandatory initial 3-month testing period, there are no commitments, for either party. We stay if it's a win-win.
- Proven, current track record - Eg. For one partner in December 2020, we collected $2.2m across Google and Facebook at an average ROI of 12.3 (results not typical).


## About you

The offer is open to you if:

- You run a relatively simple, profitable, and ethical business
- You're willing and able to quickly and easily scale once ads are profitable (no major operational ceilings, budget constraints, or red tape) - so we both stand to make good money from our work together
- You're happy to leave us to do the work and produce results - you're not going to feel uncomfortable with a lack of pretty reports and diagrams, and you certainly don't want 3 calls a week so we can convince you of the "benefits" of more likes on your Facebook page.


## About us

- We're small by design - We value quality over quantity in all things, and we keep things simple so we're able to focus deeply on doing great work for the few, not the many.
- "T-stacked" abilities - Before founding, Cameron, our principal, worked in all domains of the customer experience - from grassroots events and awareness-based promotions for major brands like Škoda and VW, to cutting his teeth in cold-calling and door-to-door sales (business and consumer), and even developing high-end websites and marketing funnels (from high-level strategy down to button-clicking and coding), before focusing in on digital advertising.
- Fundamentals over flash - Technology trends, marketing tactics, and even entire advertising platforms come and go... But the fundamentals of business, sales, and human nature (, creativity, experimentation... these) stay largely the same. If you have a firm grasp of the fundamental principles, you can invent your own tactics. And if you don't - no chatbot or sneaky ad trickery (acrobatics) could possibly save you.


## The typical process

- After filling out the form on this page, you'll get an email with a link to Cameron's calendar, where you can schedule a call.
- We'll hop on the call and discuss your business. We'll go through a series of questions to understand your business and your goals, and to get a good feel for whether we'll be able to help you or not, and to see if it's a good fit. If not, we'll tell you.
- If it is, we'll work through terms and come to a simple, win-win agreement as quickly as possible. Usually, this involves a 3-month initial commitment (to give the ads time to work themselves out), and performance-based pricing. If your funnel is unvalidated (has not previously been significantly profitable), or you need one built, there will be substantial setup and retainer fees until it's suitably profitable, at which point we can switch format.
- Once that's out the way, we'll collect what we need from you and your team - like assets, account access, information on your business and customers - and get to work, starting at high level strategy and working down to the nitty gritty. We'll begin testing and experimenting as soon as possible, and we'll look to scale as soon as comfortably profitable.
- You and your team will receive basic spending and ROI reports, we'll hop on calls occasionally when it's genuinely useful, and we'll invoice you in alignment with out agreement. Our partnership will likely be simple, effortless, and very mutually profitable.



## Caveats and final words

- The primacy of the product - You don't need us to tell you that no matter how good the marketing is, if you have a subpar product or service, it won't be enough. Therefore, it's best if you don't seek to work with us if you're not proud of the core of your business. On the other hand, this is also one of the benefits of an advertising partner - it frees up bandwidth to focus on listening to the customer and improving their experience... and then everyone benefits even more. As a side note, this is the same reason why we keep our own marketing (ad and website) so minimal - it frees us up to focus more on our partners' ads.
- Realistic expectations - ... no guarantee, no refunds... Digital ads aren’t valid for everyone, and I try to sniff that out before we even get on a call together, and won’t proceed after the call unless I feel confident. But it is still a gamble, and by proceeding, you understand that.
- You have to lose before you can win - ... please don't gamble the last of your savings - you should be able to comfortable lose a decent chunk of change and just write it off as "testing budget" and "just another experiment".



## CTA





(

If I’ve gotten you more interested than you’ve ever been before in an advertising partner, chances are I can do the same for you and your clients.

If you’re interested but now’s not the right time, personally or professionally, (or you can’t see the other form on the page, meaning I’m currently not accepting new clients) - You’re welcome to put your email in this box and submit. I don’t market, I don’t sell, I don’t bug or spam or anything. The only emails you’ll ever get from me will look like this:

Ready to work together?
-> link

Subj - name

And they’ll come once a quarter, manually, unless I’m not looking for new business.
